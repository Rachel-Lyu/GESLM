A toy dataset for testing the codes.
There are 8 parameter settings where MAF = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and $r^2$ = 0.7, 0.9 respectively.
Each parameter setting has 10 toy files with a sample size of 5000.
Each file contains 106 SNPs. There are two diseases involved: disease1 and disease2.
SNP A and B are directly related to disease1, A and C are directly related to disease2.
Y1, Z1, W1 are directly related to A, B, C respectively but have no significant association with the two diseases.
